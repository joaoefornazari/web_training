# Web_Training
Training HTML, CSS and JS.

## What is this project?

An Instagram profile recommended some ideas to train developing in any language. One of them was to _insert numbers and concatenate them as you insert it_. So, I've got my hands on that simple idea to train my front-end skills.

## What it does?

When you get on the website, this screen wil show up.

Choose a number from 1 to 9. _(Note: the input field still allows you to insert numbers with more than two digits. Gotta fix that later)_

![Picking a number.](https://github.com/joaoefornazari/web_training/blob/main/website2.png?raw=true)

When you hit Enter, the number you picked will be below the input field.

And, if you pick another number and press Enter again, the current number will be concatenated with the previous one!

## Future possible additions:

- Node.js + SQL: store each number on a databank and having the option of search numbers.
- Maybe transform this on a telephone number list?

### See ya!
