Training HTML, CSS and JS.

## What is this project?

An Instagram profile recommended some ideas to train developing in any language. One of them was to _insert numbers and concatenate them as you insert it_.

I'm trying to do exactly that, with HTML + CSS + JS.

## Project _status quo_

HTML and CSS are nicely working. JavaScript isn't doing anything (yet). As the _input_ has no button, I want it to show the number
below it _when I hit Enter_ on my keyboard. Tried this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/905222/prevent-form-submission-on-enter-key-press. Didn't work.
